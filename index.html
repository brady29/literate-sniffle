  <p>The objective of the requirements stage is to gather and detail information regarding what the software is going to be achieving.
    This phase involves communication amongst all parties: project managers, developers, clients, shareholders, end users and many more.
    During this crucial stage, the project team identifies the project scope, objectives, functionalities and user expectations.
    Clear and comprehensive requirements create a  foundation upon which the software design process is outlined. They provide a roadmap
    for the developers, guiding them in making design decisions and developing software aligned with the client's needs and expectations.
    A well-defined requirements stage helps in minimizing misunderstandings, reducing the risk of project failure, and ensuring that the 
    final product meets the desired quality standards. It is the backbone of the entire software development lifecycle, emphasizing the 
    importance of thorough analysis and understanding before any coding or designing begins.</p>

  <p>Apple IOS 17 user stories:

      The third chapter of the Subject to Change textbook tackles the aspects of empathy and the lack thereof in business models. Empathy as explained in the 
      text is made of understanding customer emotions, culture, context,  behaviours, motivations and meanings. As explained in the text, when business models
      integrate the ideas into the design process, companies can create better products. They can do this by embracing the ideas, and create products and services
      that consider not only customer needs, but also how they will interact with the product. The more old school centric business models discussed are the
      “sheep”, “homo economicus”, and “task and goal” models. The “sheep” business model viewed the customer as a passive player. Problems arise when this model
      is used, as a big disconnect can be formed with the marketing of a given product, and the product itself. Lacking empathy by not considering customers’
      emotions and motivations, as companies simply wanted to control and create consumer demand. The “homo economicus” makes the assumption of rational decision
      making aspects of customer motivations. Issues occur when companies place more interest in making products that people will buy, and not products they will
      use, or will have practical use. Focusing on their preferences and not considering the emotional or cultural aspects that comprise customer behaviour, both 
      in marketing and product use. The “task and goals” model is the oversimplification of customer motivations, reducing them to tasks and goals. Incorrectly 
      modeling humans as robot-like users that are simply there to accomplish a task. The lack of empathy with this model comes with the neglection of the 
      complexity of customer behaviour, not focusing on how the consumer will actually use the product.

  <p>The product that I am going to be talking about today is Apple’s Airtag. an AirTag is a small, coin-shaped device developed by Apple. It is used to help 
    people keep track of and locate their personal items, such as keys, wallets, bags, or other belongings. Giving users real-time data on where their items
    are. Beyond these basic functions, the vision was to create a tracking service for apple users and their products. The creation of the FindMy app was the 
    real pièce de résistance of the project. Installed on all apple devices by default, the genius design of FindMy has impacted the experience of Apple products
    across the whole ecosystem of products. Acting as a home for all of your Apple devices. Displaying the location of a user's Airtags, Airpods, IPhones and even
    people. Airtag not only created a great product with very precise active location data but also created a network of all the user’s Apple devices for a user.

  <p>Prototyping is a development technique in software design that involves the creation of a mock version of a system, software, product or application. The 
    main purpose is the visualization of an idea. It helps developers refine the design and functionality, as well as the user experience before final outlines
    and developments are made on the product. The prototype has immense significance in the development phase allowing the developer to take ideas and experiments
    to customers. Gathering valuable input and feedback regarding the product and how they wish for it to evolve before the delivery of the product. Enhancing 
    the communication provides a tangible representation of a developers vision, making it easier for customers, users and engineers to be on the same page for 
    project requirements. In addition, it helps developers identify early stage problems that could go overlooked. Giving a visual to the design can make sometimes
    easily overlooked issues become apparent such as clearance issues, data formatting issues, security threats, lack of memory and much more. Granting access to
    test users and gathering ideas and feedback is also quite valuable. Allowing real users to interact with a more preliminary version of the software allows for
    the integration and implementations of bug fixes and new ideas, bettering the final product. Creating a paper prototype is a common way of prototyping that
    involves only a couple of steps. Starting by understanding the key ideas/goals of the software. Then sketching an outline of the desired user interface, 
    creating a rough design of the screens and user interactions on paper as well. The testing of the prototype is done in person, manually moving the user 
    through screens and testing their inputs, gathering feedback given to you.

Communication
	High-level communication is an incredibly important building block in the software design process. Keeping all parties aligned with the direction and vision of 
    the product, delivering a stronger product that better aligns with client and developer vision. Giving a shared understanding of what the proposed idea and 
    next steps are keeps all members informed and their efforts aligned. Likewise, helping designers make decisions and problem solve. They can  easily tackle the
    inevitable roadblocks along the development process when proper communication occurs not only when problems arise, but throughout the problem solving stage
    as well. Where team members can gather, brainstorm and make more educated decisions as a collective. These are all possible when clarity, listening and
    collaboration are embraced as key elements of communication. Clarity removes all ambiguity and helps those who are working on the project understand the work
    or ideas of others. Listening promotes a deeper understanding of the work being done by the group and the reasons behind decisions that are made. Collaboration
    can create an environment where team members work together and don’t waste their efforts, sometimes another set of eyes and ears can be crucial in problem
    solving. Thinking of experiences of poor communication, I look back to this weekend. For Halloween, me and my friends decided on a last-minute costume to all 
    dress as Toronto Maple leafs, wearing our jerseys and going out together. However, we soon realized we had all worn Auston Matthews jerseys. Leading to us not
    dressing as the Toronto Maple Leafs, but all as Auston Matthews. Given what I have learned in class, I would embrace the principle that there aren’t any silly 
    questions. A simple question of which jersey me and my friends were wearing could have avoided the situation we found ourselves in.

The accessibility principle is when designers create products or interfaces that people of all abilities can use and access, including those with disabilities.
    In software design, it means creating software that will be used and understood by everyone and the implementation of features that will assist those with
    disabilities and promote inclusivity with software. A principle which will be very involved in the design process of my dog dashboard, that I will create
    in design assignment 2 .Creating an interface for people of all usage levels will be very important, as people of all different abilities own dogs, some even
    using them as service animals in their daily lives. For example, ensuring that the dashboard is compatible with a screen reader or offering other non text
    ways of delivering information. A visually impaired user should be able to receive information about their dog's walks or vaccinations through auditory or
    methods of presentation. I recently had a great experience in inclusivity with the recent update of my mobile banking app. When entering the app, all
    information was reduced to the essentials and formatted very well. This change will very positively impact my grandmother who has quite low dexterity on her
    phone. Furthermore there was an introduction of a high contrast mode as well as voice input that occurred a few iterations ago. However, simplified
    information was not present on my recent trip to Portugal. When in restaurants it was always very difficult to read the menus, as they were translated
    (poorly) into many different languages on the same page. This led to all of the pages being cluttered with information, as well as the use of a very
    small typeface. Leading to my mom having difficulty reading it on occasion.

Disguised ads are a deceptive pattern that have implications which are violations of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. Disguised ads are created
	when users are presented with ads which are similar or may look identical to native content. Which is a violation of principle 1.2 in the ACM Code, avoid
	harm. Disguised ads can cause harm when users may be exposed to a disclosure of information they did not wish to share outside of their native content.
	Furthermore, it could expose them to deceptive practices or compromise their own privacy and security. Additionally it is in violation of Principle 1.3
	focusing on honesty and trustworthiness. A principle which is contradicted by the lack of transparency a user is subjected to with these ads. Being shown
	or directed to content that may be inappropriate or unrelated to the perceived content in the ad. Moreover, Principle 1.5, which highlights the work 
	required to produce new ideas and creative content. This idea is compromised when disguised ads mislead users about the origin or purpose of the content.
	When blurring the lines between genuine native content and sponsored materials, deceptive patterns undermine the value of real or native creative works
	and ideas. Users may unknowingly be contributing their attention and engagement to content that is financially motivated, diminishing the credibility and
	appreciation for true and honest creative efforts. In summary, disguised ads not only are in violation of the principles of avoid harm, focus on honesty 
	and trustworthiness, but also degrade the honest and hard work that good content creators put in.

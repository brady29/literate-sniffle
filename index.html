  <h1>The Requirements stage</h1>
  <p>The objective of the requirements stage is to gather and detail information regarding what the software is going to be achieving.
    This phase involves communication amongst all parties: project managers, developers, clients, shareholders, end users and many more.
    During this crucial stage, the project team identifies the project scope, objectives, functionalities and user expectations.
    Clear and comprehensive requirements create a  foundation upon which the software design process is outlined. They provide a roadmap
    for the developers, guiding them in making design decisions and developing software aligned with the client's needs and expectations.
    A well-defined requirements stage helps in minimizing misunderstandings, reducing the risk of project failure, and ensuring that the 
    final product meets the desired quality standards. It is the backbone of the entire software development lifecycle, emphasizing the 
    importance of thorough analysis and understanding before any coding or designing begins.</p>

  <h1>5 Example User Stories</h1>
  <p>Apple IOS 17 user stories:
As a non tech savvy user I want an easy to understand interface so that I can see all my main and necessary apps in one place.
As a tech savvy user I want access to more settings to play with my camera so that I can adjust aperture and other features and get the most out of the high power cameras.
As a multitasking user I want access to more multitasking capabilities, so that I can have multiple applications open at the same time and be able to easily switch between them.
As a content creator I want a stronger post production tool so that I can create high level photos and videos without relying on third party applications.
As a business user, I want better document sharing so I can share relevant documents in a more seamless way, making file sharing easier amongst my teams.

  <h1>Writing assignment 3</h1>

      The third chapter of the Subject to Change textbook tackles the aspects of empathy and the lack thereof in business models. Empathy as explained in the 
      text is made of understanding customer emotions, culture, context,  behaviours, motivations and meanings. As explained in the text, when business models
      integrate the ideas into the design process, companies can create better products. They can do this by embracing the ideas, and create products and services
      that consider not only customer needs, but also how they will interact with the product. The more old school centric business models discussed are the
      “sheep”, “homo economicus”, and “task and goal” models. The “sheep” business model viewed the customer as a passive player. Problems arise when this model
      is used, as a big disconnect can be formed with the marketing of a given product, and the product itself. Lacking empathy by not considering customers’
      emotions and motivations, as companies simply wanted to control and create consumer demand. The “homo economicus” makes the assumption of rational decision
      making aspects of customer motivations. Issues occur when companies place more interest in making products that people will buy, and not products they will
      use, or will have practical use. Focusing on their preferences and not considering the emotional or cultural aspects that comprise customer behaviour, both 
      in marketing and product use. The “task and goals” model is the oversimplification of customer motivations, reducing them to tasks and goals. Incorrectly 
      modeling humans as robot-like users that are simply there to accomplish a task. The lack of empathy with this model comes with the neglection of the 
      complexity of customer behaviour, not focusing on how the consumer will actually use the product.

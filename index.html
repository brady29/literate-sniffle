  <h1>The Requirements stage</h1>
  <p>The objective of the requirements stage is to gather and detail information regarding what the software is going to be achieving.
    This phase involves communication amongst all parties: project managers, developers, clients, shareholders, end users and many more.
    During this crucial stage, the project team identifies the project scope, objectives, functionalities and user expectations.
    Clear and comprehensive requirements create a  foundation upon which the software design process is outlined. They provide a roadmap
    for the developers, guiding them in making design decisions and developing software aligned with the client's needs and expectations.
    A well-defined requirements stage helps in minimizing misunderstandings, reducing the risk of project failure, and ensuring that the 
    final product meets the desired quality standards. It is the backbone of the entire software development lifecycle, emphasizing the 
    importance of thorough analysis and understanding before any coding or designing begins.</p>
